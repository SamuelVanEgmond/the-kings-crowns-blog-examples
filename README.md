If you want create your own environment like the one in the The King's Crowns, this is where you should look.
The game itself was written for small size and in a month, so minimal code cleanup was done and there are some mistakes I didn't bother to fix.
For the examples in this repository I did do a lot of code cleanup so they form a much better starting point.

All examples from the blog are in the examples folder.<br>
But index.html contains the end result, i.e. use that as your starting point if you want to start your own project.

Don't forget, you need a [local web server for A-Frame development](https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/installation.html#local-development)!
